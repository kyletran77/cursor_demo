# Broadcom Angular to React Refactor Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan to convert the Broadcom Angular application to React, maintaining all existing functionality, pages, and features while following React best practices.

## Current Angular Application Structure

Based on the documentation analysis, the current Angular application includes:

### Pages
- **Home Page**: Landing page with hero section, stats, solutions preview, featured products, and CTA
- **Solutions Page**: Enterprise solutions with detailed grid and benefits section
- **Products Page**: Product portfolio organized by categories with featured products
- **Company Page**: Company information including overview, leadership, business segments, and values

### Current Angular Architecture
- Standalone components with lazy loading
- Route-based navigation (`/`, `/solutions`, `/products`, `/company`)
- Static data management within components
- Component-based organization under `src/app/pages/`

## React Conversion Strategy

### 1. Project Setup and Architecture

#### Initial Setup
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite (for fast development and build)
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or Styled Components (maintain current SCSS approach)
- **State Management**: React Context API (for shared data) + useState/useReducer
- **Component Structure**: Functional components with hooks

#### Folder Structure
```

├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── common/          # Shared components (Header, Footer, Button, etc.)
│   └── ui/              # Basic UI elements
├── pages/               # Page components
│   ├── Home/
│   ├── Solutions/
│   ├── Products/
│   └── Company/
├── data/                # Static data (moved from components)
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
├── styles/              # Global styles and variables
├── utils/               # Utility functions
└── App.tsx              # Main application component
```

### 2. Page-by-Page Conversion Plan

#### 2.1 Home Page (`/`)
**Angular Features to Convert:**
- Hero section with floating cards
- Stats section with metrics
- Solutions preview grid
- Featured products list
- Call-to-action section

**React Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/pages/Home/HomePage.tsx
- Create main HomePage component
- Extract sections into separate components:
  - HeroSection
  - StatsSection  
  - SolutionsPreview
  - FeaturedProducts
  - CTASection
- Move stats data to src/data/homeData.ts
- Implement navigation to Solutions page
```

**Key Considerations:**
- Convert Angular's data arrays to TypeScript interfaces
- Implement responsive floating cards animation
- Add proper loading states for future API integration

#### 2.2 Solutions Page (`/solutions`)

- Company overview with mission and history
- Leadership team grid with avatars and bios
- Business segments display
- Company values section

**React Implementation:**
```typescript
// src/pages/Company/CompanyPage.tsx
- Create main CompanyPage component
- Extract components:
  - CompanyHero
  - CompanyOverview
  - LeadershipGrid
  - BusinessSegments
  - CompanyValues
- Move company data to src/data/companyData.ts
- Implement leader avatar generation
```

**Key Considerations:**
- Convert leadership team data structure
- Implement business segments with icons
- Maintain company values with proper iconography

### 3. Shared Components

#### 3.1 Layout Components
- **Header**: Navigation with responsive menu
- **Footer**: Links and company information
- **Layout**: Main wrapper component

#### 3.2 UI Components
- **Button**: Reusable button with variants
- **Card**: Consistent card component for all sections
- **Icon**: Centralized icon system
- **Avatar**: For leadership team display

### 4. Data Management Strategy

#### 4.1 Static Data Structure
Convert Angular component data to centralized TypeScript modules:

```typescript
// src/data/types.ts
export interface Solution {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  icon: string;
  features: string[];
  products: string[];
}

export interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  description: string;
  features: string[];
  benefits: string[];
}

export interface Leader {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  title: string;
  bio: string;
  initials: string;
}
```

#### 4.2 Data Files
- `src/data/homeData.ts` - Stats, solutions preview, featured products
- `src/data/solutionsData.ts` - Solutions grid and benefits
- `src/data/productsData.ts` - Product categories and featured products
- `src/data/companyData.ts` - Leadership, business segments, values

### 5. Routing Implementation

```typescript
// src/App.tsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Navigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const App = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Layout>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/solutions" element={<SolutionsPage />} />
        <Route path="/products" element={<ProductsPage />} />
        <Route path="/company" element={<CompanyPage />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<Navigate to="/" replace />} />
      </Routes>
    </Layout>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

### 6. Styling Strategy

#### 6.1 Current SCSS Conversion
- Convert existing SCSS to CSS Modules or Styled Components
- Maintain current color scheme and design system
- Implement responsive breakpoints
- Create shared style variables

#### 6.2 Component Styling
- Each component gets its own style file
- Shared styles in global stylesheet
- CSS custom properties for theming
