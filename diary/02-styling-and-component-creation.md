# Diary: Styling and Component Creation

This entry covers the implementation of the visual design and the creation of the main application components.

## Key Changes:

1.  **Branding and Design System**:
    *   Researched Broadcom's official branding, including their primary colors (Red: `#CC092F`, Blue: `#0092B2`, Black: `#000000`, White: `#FFFFFF`).
    *   A global stylesheet (`styles.scss`) was created to define a consistent design system, including typography, buttons, and a responsive grid.

2.  **Component Development**:
    *   **`app.component.ts`**: The main application component was built to include the header, navigation, router outlet, and footer.
    *   **Home Page**: An interactive landing page (`home.component.ts`) was created, featuring a hero section with animated floating cards, company statistics, and previews of solutions and products.
    *   **Solutions, Products, and Company Pages**: Additional pages were created to showcase Broadcom's solutions, products, and company information, each with a professional and consistent design.

## Revelations:

-   By centralizing the design system in `styles.scss`, it was possible to maintain a consistent look and feel across all components, making the development process more efficient.
-   The use of standalone components in Angular 17 simplified the architecture by reducing the need for NgModules.
-   The interactive elements on the home page, such as the animated floating cards, were created using CSS animations, which provided a modern and engaging user experience without relying on external libraries.
