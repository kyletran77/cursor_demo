# Diary: Initial Project Setup

This entry documents the initial setup of the Broadcom demo website.

## Key Changes:

1.  **Project Scaffolding**: Created the foundational files for an Angular project, including `package.json`, `angular.json`, and `tsconfig.json`.
2.  **Angular 17 Configuration**: Initially, the project was set up to use Angular 17, with corresponding dependencies and configurations.
3.  **Core Application Files**: The initial `index.html`, `main.ts`, and `styles.scss` were created to establish the basic structure and styling of the application.
4.  **Routing**: The main application routes were defined in `app.routes.ts`, setting up the navigation structure for the website.

## Revelations:

-   The initial setup was based on the latest version of Angular, which later proved to be incompatible with the user's Node.js environment. This highlighted the importance of verifying environment compatibility early in the development process.
-   The file structure was organized to support a component-based architecture, with separate directories for pages, which made the codebase modular and easy to navigate.
