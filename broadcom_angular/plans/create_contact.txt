Okay, let's generate some sample and demo values to flesh out the "Contact" page. Based on your request to follow themes from the Company Page, I'm assuming a similar structured approach. Here’s a breakdown of potential sections and demo values for the Contact page, mirroring the Company Page's structure. I’m aiming to provide realistic-looking data that you can adapt as needed.

I. Hero Section:

Title: "Get in Touch"
Subtitle: “We’re here to help. Reach out and let us know how we can assist you.”
II. Contact Information:

Heading: "Contact Details"
Demo Values (Displayed as Cards or List Items):
Address: 16210 S. Willow Pkwy, San Jose, CA 95134
Phone: +1-408-995-1234
Email: 

 (or a more specific email like support@, sales@)
Website: 

III. Contact Form (Optional, but likely):

Heading: "Send Us a Message"
Form Fields (Demo Values for Validation/Display):
Name: John Doe
Email: 

Subject: Inquiry about product X
Message: "I'm interested in learning more about your product X. Could you please provide me with some additional information?"
Button Text: "Submit"
IV. Map (Optional):

Heading: “Find Our Location”
Map Integration (Placeholder): A placeholder for a map integration, potentially using Google Maps or similar.
Map Marker: San Jose, CA
V. Social Media Links (Optional):

Heading: "Connect With Us"
Demo Values (Displayed as Icons/Links):
LinkedIn Icon & Link: 

Twitter Icon & Link: 

Facebook Icon & Link: 

VI. Support Resources (Optional):

Heading: "Support & Resources"
Demo Values (Displayed as List Items or Cards):
Link to FAQs: 

Link to Knowledge Base: 

Link to Support Portal: support.broadcom.com
VII. Privacy Policy & Terms of Service (Important Legal Section):

Heading: "Legal Information"
Demo Values (Links to Legal Pages):
Privacy Policy: 

Terms of Service: 

Now that we have some sample and demo values, let's move on to the next step.

Considering this structure and these sample values, what specific Angular components or services do you envision being used to manage this data and functionality (e.g., a ContactService for handling form submissions, or a component that fetches and displays the contact information)? Knowing this will help me tailor the prompt to generate code that integrates seamlessly with your existing codebase.
